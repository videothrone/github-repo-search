# Github Repo Search

"Github Repo Search" was a little one-day build done during my stint at [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced.academy/program/full-stack-web-development/).

## Demo

https://videothrone.github.io/github-repo-search/

## Tech

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Handlebars.js, Github API, AJAX

## Features

-   When users arrive at the page they are asked to enter their GitHub username and password (to not run up against rate limits).

-   Allows users to see a list of public repos belonging to a GitHub user that they specify and to see the last 5 commits made to each by clicking on each info card.

## Goals while doing the project

-   Learning Handlebars to render things, doing AJAX requests (the Auth header in this case) and working with an API
